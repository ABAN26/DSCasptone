# Welcome to Final Proyect of Data Science on Coursera 
The objective of the course is to train a model with supervised learning to establish the success or failure of landing the first stage of the Falcon 9 for a fictitious company. To do this, data from a SpaceX API and web scarping were used. In this work you will find the parts that make up a data science project itself. From data collection, cleaning, visualization and model training
